In November 2021 I was part of a small team ('Tychologen') that took part in the Cyber Security Days 2021 thankfully organized by the Ostschweizer Fachhochschule.

This is a short write-up for one of the web security challenges called "Muffin Shop", which was rated with medium difficulty.

I will publish two differnet solutions here. At first my own and then a shorter and smarter method by Lexiea, who also took part in the event.
